## Aloha
Welcome. This post explains about how I approached building my personal portfolio.

## ROYGBIV?  
In Hawaii it's no phenomenon that you see a rainbow everyday. Seeing rainbows on a day to day bases has influenced me to pay attention to the visible color spectrum. The reason for choosing the domain **roygbiv** was because it translates directly to the the visible color spectrum which is *red, orange, yellow, blue, indigo and  violet* **ROYGBIV**. While viewing [roygbiv.green](http://roygbiv.green){:target="_blank"} you'll notice a few references to the color spectrum including Issac Newtons color wheel. If you'd like to learn more about  **ROYGBIV** and the major significance it has to Issac Newton then read this article all about [The Dimensions of Color](http://www.huevaluechroma.com/071.php){:target="_blank"}. It's fascinating and worth every bit of your time.

## Shape

In the early stages of designing [roygbiv.green](http://roygbiv.green){:target="_blank"} I set a rule in place for myself to follow. The rule was to **simply make it your own**, don't copy or look at what other front end developers or designers are making for there portfolios. This is **my portfolio** and it needed to be **unique and personal**.  I wanted to tell a  **story** about *who I am* , *where I am from* and *what I do* . This was my only rule.  I envisioned a site that used the essence of simplicity and story to communicate to my audience.

Every time I faced a design challenge I used this rule to help me achieve a creative solution. I used my sketchbook to visually think out my challenges. I like to call it **creative problem solving**. This approach never let me down. I was able to solve any issue that arose confidently. The end result is a site that is not just any site, it's a *portfolio* that reflects my personality and gives viewers a chance to *connect with me through the design*. It's **personal**.

## Craft
[roygbiv.green](http://roygbiv.green){:target="_blank"} is not built with multiple frameworks. It's built wit bare **HTML, SVG, SCSS and jQuery** . I applied the same rule to this approach. *I wanted to craft the code.* You might notice that I used quite a bit of inline *SVG* in the site. I've taken a likening to how `SVG` really lets you have creative control over what you can create in the browser. There really is no end to what you can create with it. For the layout I used **Flexbox** as my grid system.
I used **jQuery** mainly on the project pages where I added some dynamic content and hovering effects on the individual images. In full the site has very few frameworks, it's **very fast** and extremely user friendly.

All thanks to the handy little rule I set in place in the beginning.

For the build system I used **gulp** with **browsersync** and a handful of other tools to help ease to process of building a modern website.

## Aloha
Welcome :)

## ROYGBIV?  
In Hawaii it's no phenomenon that you'll seem to see a Rainbow everyday. Being that I grew up around rainbows then it makes sense to have the main theme behind [roygbiv.green](https//www.roygbiv.green) the color spectrum. Inside the rainbow you have all the colors in the visible color spectrum which is **roygbiv**. If you don't know what **roygbiv** stands for or how it might relate to the rainbow then here's the meaning  *red, orange, yellow, blue, indigo and  violet* . While browsing the site you'll [roygbiv.green](https//www.roygbiv.green) you'll notice a few references to the color spectrum including Issac Newtons color wheel.  

## Timeline

When I started building [roygbiv.green](https//www.roygbiv.green) I thought it wouldn't take more than a few months to complete it. I was wrong. I took a year to complete it. The key to getting a good result was patience and creativity. I believe the best things in life take time. Nothing worth it is instant.

## Shape
From the very beginning of building [roygbiv.green](https//www.roygbiv.green) my only goal was to keep it simple. I set after a layout that used white space to convey the message of simplicity to my audience.

In the early stages of designing [roygbiv.green](https//www.roygbiv.green) I set a rule in place for myself to follow. The rule was to **simply make it your own** don't copy or look at what other front end developers or designers are making for there portfolios. This is **my portfolio** and it needs to be unique and **personal**.  I wanted to tell a  **story** about *who I am* , *where I am from* and *what I do*. This was my only rule.

Every time I faced a design challenge I used this rule to help me achieve a creative solution. I used my sketchbook to visually think out my designs and problem. I like to call this *creative problem solving*. This approach never left me stranded or let me down. I was able to solve any issue that arose confidently. The end result is a site that is not just any site. It reflects personality and gives viewers a chance to connect with me and learn about what I do and who I am. It's **personal**.

## Craft
[roygbiv.green](https//www.roygbiv.green) is not built with multiple frameworks. It's built wit bare **HTML, SVG, SCSS and jQuery** . I applied the same rule to this approach. *I wanted to craft the code.* You might notice that I used quite a bit of inline *SVG* in the site. I've taken a likening to how `SVG` really lets you have creative control over what you can create in the browser. There really is no end to what you can create with it. For the layout I used **Flexbox** as my griding system.
I used **jQuery** mainly on the project pages where I used it to add dynamic content and hovering effects on the individual images towards the bottom of the page. All in all the site has very few frameworks and is very fast and user friendly thanks to the rule I set in place.

For the build system I used **gulp** with **browsersync** and a handful of other tools to help ease to process of building a site. If you'd like to learn about my build system or inspect the code base then take a look at the repo here [ePortfolio](https://github.com/kapena/e-portfolio)
